Hi everyone,

this week we will present you two .feature files for our use cases.

The two tests are:
- [Create Account](https://github.com/GreenClothaWay/Website/blob/master/features/CreateAccount.feature)
- [View basic information](https://github.com/GreenClothaWay/Website/blob/master/features/ProductInformation.feature)

We recommend to use the professional version of Pycharm (free for students) because it integrates behave testing.
Also the autocompletion and syntax highlighting are working just fine.
