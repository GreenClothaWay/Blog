Hi there,

In this post we present you our git repos in which we did the refactoring stuff.

[Repo_Zeno](https://github.com/zeno420/Fowler)
[Repo_Nico](https://github.com/)

We use IntelliJ as our IDE. IntelliJ offers lots of refactoring methods. Such as Rename (variable,function,...) or Move/Extract Function.
All methods used during refactoring can be seen in the [commit messages](https://github.com/zeno420/Fowler/commits/master).

We also integrated a [tool](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-issue-branch) in the repo that enables automated creation of branches based on an issue. This leads to clean working tree. 

Best regards,

The GreenClothaWay-Team
