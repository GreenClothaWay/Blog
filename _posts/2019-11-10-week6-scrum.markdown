Hi there,

this week we worked on our project management tool. We use youtrack and like it so far.
We integrated it in our IDE (Pycharm)

We also worked on the integration of Git. As you can see in the next screenshot we use commands in our commits that will affect
issues in youtrack.

And here is how it looks in youtrack. You can see that the state of the issue changed.

Last but not least we made a scrum board and our first sprint. As we are new to sprints and scrum and all that stuff it is not perfect yet.
In the scrum board you can also see that time tracking is enabled in youtrack. Time can be logged by commands in commits as well (something like "work Development 1h").

If you are interested in a deeper dive into our project management feel free to do so and visit our [youtrack](https://greenclothaway.myjetbrains.com/).
