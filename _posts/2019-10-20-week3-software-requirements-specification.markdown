Hi everyone,

this week we worked on two documents:
- the Software Requirements Specification Document
- the Overall Use Case Diagram (OUCD).

You can find them on github:

[Software Requirements Specification](https://github.com/GreenClothaWay/Website/blob/master/SRS.md)

[Overall Use Case Diagram](https://github.com/GreenClothaWay/Website/blob/master/GCW_UML.png)

An overview of our OUCD can also be seen here:
