Hi there,

In this post we present you our first Unittests.

Pycharm as our IDE supports automated testing. If you use this feauture it will run Tests with your desired Testframework every time you change something in your code.

We wrote testcode for our [create account use case](https://github.com/GreenClothaWay/Website/blob/master/GreenClothaWay/src/account/tests.py)

The tests are passing at this point.

Also we uploaded a [TestPlan](https://github.com/GreenClothaWay/Website/blob/master/doc/TestPlan.odt).

Best regards,
The GreenClothaWay-Team
