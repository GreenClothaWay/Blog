Hi there,

In order to host our website we needed a server. After buying a server at Hetzner we installed a debian distribution and configured the servers ssh port. Otherwise it would have been under attack all the time. 

Furthermore we discussed about technical requirements such as firewalls and certificates. 

Afterwards we configured a simple firewall using shorewall. Following we installed a nginx webserver and requested a certificate from Lets Encrypt using certbot.

Best regards,
