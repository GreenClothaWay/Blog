Hi there,

this week we have to describe the framework we use and give you an overview about MVC connected to it and in our code. 

Four our Backend we use django. It is for python and brings the MVC structure right with it. Django uses the MTV structure not MVC tho.
But the differenc eis negligible.

MTV architecture consists of three parts:
- first is a set of tools that make working with data and databases much easier
- second is a templating system that can be used by non-programmers
- third is a framework that handles communication between the user and the database and automates many of the painful parts of managing a complex website

Parts 1 and 2 are relatable:
- Models are the tools we use to work with data and databases
- Templates provide a designer friendly plain-text templating system

For our sorted classdiagram we tried to place our functions corresponding to the the MVC structure.

We also began to fill our Software-Architecture-Documentation ([SAD](https://github.com/GreenClothaWay/Website/blob/master/doc/SAD.md)) this week.

Best regards,
