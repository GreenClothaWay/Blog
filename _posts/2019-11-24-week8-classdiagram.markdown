Hi there,

this week we created a ER database model and UML class diagrams for our promised use cases.

Firstly, we created the ER database model, that we can create models for each use case.

<br>

It was very easy to build our models, because Django provides a lot of Models. This lightened our workload. After that, we built the UML class diagrams. It was very easy to create the class diagrams. PyCharm Professional provides a plugin to create class diagrams automatically. So, we had only to create our models and the rest did Pycharm.
