Hi there,

this week we created a ER database model and UML class diagrams for our promised use cases.

Firstly, we created the ER database model, that we can create models for each use case.

It was very easy to build our models, because Django provides a lot of Models. This lightened our workload. After that, we built the UML class diagrams. It was very easy to create the class diagrams. PyCharm Professional provides a plugin to create class diagrams automatically. So, we had only to create our models and the rest did Pycharm.
