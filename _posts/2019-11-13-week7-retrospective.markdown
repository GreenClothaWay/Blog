Hi there,

this week we had an external person in class for a retrospective.

What went well?

<br>
We started by taking time to collect things we like in our project and work environment.
- working atmosphere
- our idea
- how free of fear our communication is

What can be done better?

<br>
The next step was to determine stuff we should work on.
- our motivation
- sense of duty
- technical background

What are actions to improve?

<br>
The final time was dedicated to think about two solutions for our top two priority problems.
- read more about the technical background and get some 'hands on'-time
- get our shit together

Best regards,
The GreenClothaWay-Team
