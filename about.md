We are three Students from Germany. We are very interested and engagered to protect our planet.
We want to reduce the consumption of cotton and polyester.

Most of the people buy new clothes although their old clothes are still in good condition.
Gradually, wardrobe gets fuller and fuller. Then people sort out their old clothes and trash they.

Exactly at this point our idea may prevent this throwaway. Our Idea is based on a free tradingplace for clothing. 
You can offer old clothes or clothes that you donÂ´t like anymore. 
There are a lot of people who still like your clothes.

This idea may prevent some people to buy new manufactured clothes.
